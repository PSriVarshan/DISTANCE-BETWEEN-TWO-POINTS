# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1: 
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculations
### Step 2: 
Enter the coordinates of point one and two in the input
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

import math
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
d = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
